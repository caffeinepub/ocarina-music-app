  "summary": "The diff modifies two frontend hook files (useBackendFingerings.ts and useBackendSequences.ts) to add actor availability guards and friendly error messages, and invalidates React Query cache on success. However, there is no evidence of any changes to the Motoko backend file (backend/main.mo), which is required by REQ-26.",

      "reason": "The diff shows no changes to backend/main.mo. None of the acceptance criteria for REQ-26 (compilation without errors, correct argument types, proper result types, stable variable declarations) can be verified from the diff.",
