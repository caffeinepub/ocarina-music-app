      "featureTitle": "Fix the 'Actor not available' error that occurs when attempting to save tablature sequences or fingering configurations. In useActor.ts (read-only) the actor is created via React Query — ensure that useBackendSequences.ts and useBackendFingerings.ts wait for the actor to be fully initialized before invoking any canister calls. Add a guard that checks actor availability and either retries or surfaces a clear user-readable error message (e.g., 'Connecting to the network, please try again in a moment') instead of the raw 'actor not available' error.",
